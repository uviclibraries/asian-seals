# Modify your Vector File

If you and your group have any questions or get stuck as you work through this exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

1. Clean up and/or Simplify artwork
- If the trace has resulted in an image with far too many details and/or nodes, you can go to the top menu and **click on Path** and then **Simplify**. This will further smooth out the outline of your image. If this process gets rid of too many details, you can undo it. <img src="images/5.close_up_nodes.png" style="width:150px;float:right;" alt="">
- You can alternatively clean up the excess nodes manually, which gives you more control over the process.
- Click on the **Edit Path by Nodes tool** in the left toolbar and then click on your artwork. You should see all the little nodes (small squares along the outlines) in your artwork.
- **Click on the nodes** individually to select and then press the **Delete key** on your keyboard.
- You can also **drag the mouse** to select several at a time and **Delete** them.  <img src="images/6.change.png" style="width:175px;float:right;" alt="">
- Deleting some nodes may change the shape of your design in that area. If you click on nearby nodes, they will usually have little arms with round handles. <img src="images/7.2versions.png" style="width:200px;float:right;" alt="">
- **Click and drag** on one of these circle handles to modify that segment of the artwork. (use gif to show them being extended and shifted to another direction)


- Note: leaving some imperfections is a good idea to mimic the natural look of a hand-engraved seal.

2. Separating elements:

- If some elements of your artwork got joined in the tracing process and you would like to separate them by **selecting the eraser tool** <img src="images/8.detail.png" style="width:200px;float:right;" alt="">
- Make sure that **“Cut out from path and shapes”** and **“Break apart cut items”** are selected. You can also adjust the width of the eraser as well as other settings at this stage. 
- **Cut through the desired area**, this will likely create a rough edge. If desired, use the simplify tool over the newly separated area or adjust the nodes manually.

3. Connecting elements:

- If elements of your artwork are separated and you would like them to touch:
- **Adjust the nodes manually** by right-clicking the necessary nodes and moving them to join the desired area. 
**OR**
- Use the **“freehand draw lines”** tools and draw the necessary connections manually. If desired,  use the simplify tool over the newly drawn area.  

4. Clean up the digital art:

- **Save** before continuing to make sure you don’t lose the progress in your work.
- Click File, then Save As… to save your file. Rename if desired.
