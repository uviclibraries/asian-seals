# Creating Your Seal Art

If you and your group have any questions or get stuck as you work through this exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

1. Notes about creating your artwork:
- You can hand-write or draw your script or art on paper using brush or pen and ink on paper, or start with a digital design.
- If you are looking for a seal script variations resource, check out the following resources for ideas: [dullr.com](http://www.dullr.com){:target="_blank"}.
- Note that digitally created seal script fonts will usually be very tidy and sharp, missing the slight stroke variation that comes from handwritten or hand-carved calligraphy, so if you want a more natural look, you can use the website as a guide and write out the script on paper by hand or even print out the digital script and create variation using a pen or brush and ink.
- It is recommended that the art is solid black on a white background with no shading, for greatest contrast, which makes it easier to convert to vector. 
- Avoid using paint or ink that has a gloss to it, or a pencil, as the light of the scanner or in the room will cause reflections, and those will become distortions in the design. Matte black ink is best.
- Considering making the artwork larger than the actual size you want your seal or stamp to be, which will make it easier to work with and get the details looking the way you want them. You can shrink it down to the final size after the design is digitized. (We created a one-inch stamp using artwork that originally covered a letter-sized sheet of paper.)
